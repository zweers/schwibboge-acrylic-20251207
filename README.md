There are 3 different SB designs, all slightly different. 

-acrylic uses 3mm bolts and nuts. easy but a bit rude

-acrylic wooden pins uses 4mm wooden dowels to join the plywood. requires glue

-acrylic loops uses wooden rings around the plywood to keep the plywood together

- you can also leave the connectors altogether and glue the plywood together. in that case use acrylic-drawing and skip the 4 holes for the screws, but not the 2 holes for the PCB
